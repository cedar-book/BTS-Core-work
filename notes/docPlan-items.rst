***********************
Documentation Plan (draft)
***********************

**These items are some documentation work items that I could thought about. I've listed as a draft.  

Items
========================

1. Maintenance 
---------------
* updates/maintain current documentations (dev/how)

  - update,fix...

2. Improvement
-------------------
* improve tutorials and FAQs contents
* add links to each API calls (in the API section) to open a Doxygen location directory (?)
* glossary (General and BitShares) lists

  - add more terms


3. flowcharts
-------------------------

* create flowcharts of some processes (flows / layers)


4. Find examples (how to use)
--------------------
* where/how 'operations' have been used in the BitShares application code (programs) 

  - find sample programs areas (class/function) from the existing code (*including particular  operations/components)
  - examine
 
* how 'objects' have been used in in the BitShares functions (programs) 

  - show example coding areas
  - examine
  
* where/how classes/functions/methods have been used in the BitShares application code 

  - find sample program areas from the existing code
  - examine 
  
* Create functions list for users to find easily

  - file, name, params, short description... (*seek - better way to appeal and let users know what BitShares-Core offers)
  - (wallet, witness node, node,?)
  

5. plugins
----------------------
* introduce concept (*Alfredo's presentation material)
* how to create

  - "hello world" 
  
* find each sample cording area (how it has been used in programs) 
  
  - examine and draw a flow
  
  
6. Create and Add contents
------------------------  
* improve the System Components Elements section

  - add more features and definitions (*think about better grouping/indexing) 

* ~~look into BitShares-FC components~~ (?)
* "hello world" examples of some procedures (?) 
* add Knowledge Base section and create the contents 

  - add wiki legacy pages (.md --> .rst)
  - (e.g.) add documented issues or information that need to be documented
  
~strike~
  
7. Look into the issues (from users)
------------------------
* BitShares-Core

  - documentation of issues
  
* dev.bitshares.works

  - update/improvement
  
* how.bitshares.works

  - update/improvement
  

8. BitShares-UI
---------------------
(Probably, I can manage the upper level User guide because I am not BitShares-UI team. BitShares-UI team should add/create their version of User Guide(?))

* update

  - somehow/someone need to manage UI User Guide section
  - BitShares-UI repository issues - 'Documentation' tag to find out what need to be updated. 
 
9. Other
-----------
 
* gather BitShares discussion items (from issues or BSIP)(?)

* wallet functionalities (code/library) list to find/learn easily

  - features/functions (+ short description) 
  
* witness node functionalities (code/library) list to find/learn easily

  - features/functions (+ short description)
